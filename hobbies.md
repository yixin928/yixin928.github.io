# Hobbies



## Swimming🏊 & Badminton🏸

<br> Savor every heartbeat, every decision, and every small step forward. In water, I find a quiet space where my mind can drift aimlessly or wander into daydreams, for some moments in life are meant to be savored rather than hurried through. Playing badminton, on the other hand, demands instant decisions and quick reflexes. Often, I must anticipate and swing even before clearly seeing the shuttle, teaching me not to obsess over whether I catch it, but to focus on moving immediately. Through competitive sports, I’ve gradually nurtured a healthy mindset toward competition: the world is always filled with challenges, and rather than shrinking away in fear, we should face them bravely, appreciating our opponents instead of retreating.

## Music🎵

<br> During travels, I need music. While studying, I need music. When writing, I need music. In moments of sadness and joy, I need music.  
The most beautiful thing is playing my favorite music on my piano and guitar.
